/**
 * @brief specify a two-dimensional texture image in a compressed format
 *
 * Texturing allows elements of an image array to be read by shaders. glCompressedTexImage2Dloads a previously defined, and retrieved, compressed two-dimensional
            texture image iftargetisGL_TEXTURE_2D, or one of the
            cube map faces such asGL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_X.
            (seeglTexImage2D). IftargetisGL_TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY,datais treated as an array of compressed 1D textures. IftargetisGL_PROXY_TEXTURE_2D,GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_1D_ARRAYorGL_PROXY_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP, no data is read fromdata, but
            all of the texture image state is recalculated, checked for consistency,
            and checked against the implementation's capabilities.  If the
            implementation cannot handle a texture of the requested texture size, it
            sets all of the image state to 0, but does not generate an error (seeglGetError). To query for an entire mipmap array,
            use an image array level greater than or equal to 1. internalformatmust be a known compressed image format (such asGL_RGTC)
            or an extension-specified compressed-texture format.
            When a texture is loaded withglTexImage2Dusing a generic compressed
            texture format (e.g.,GL_COMPRESSED_RGB), the GL selects from one of
            its extensions supporting compressed textures.  In order to load the
            compressed texture image usingglCompressedTexImage2D, query the compressed texture image's
            size and format usingglGetTexLevelParameter. If a non-zero named buffer object is bound to theGL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFERtarget
            (seeglBindBuffer) while a texture image is
            specified,datais treated as a byte offset into the buffer object's data store. If the compressed data are arranged into fixed-size blocks of texels, the pixel
            storage modes can be used to select a sub-rectangle from a larger containing rectangle.
            These pixel storage modes operate in the same way as they do forglTexImage2D.
            In the following description, denote bybs,bw,bh, andbd,
            the values of pixel storage modesGL_UNPACK_COMPRESSED_BLOCK_SIZE,GL_UNPACK_COMPRESSED_BLOCK_WIDTH,GL_UNPACK_COMPRESSED_BLOCK_HEIGHT,
            andGL_UNPACK_COMPRESSED_BLOCK_DEPTH, respectively.bsis the compressed block size in bytes;bw,bh, andbdare the compressed block width, height, and depth in pixels. By default the pixel storage modesGL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH,GL_UNPACK_SKIP_ROWS,GL_UNPACK_SKIP_PIXELS,GL_UNPACK_IMAGE_HEIGHTandGL_UNPACK_SKIP_IMAGESare ignored for compressed images. To enableGL_UNPACK_SKIP_PIXELSandGL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH,bsandbwmust both be non-zero.
            To also enableGL_UNPACK_SKIP_ROWSandGL_UNPACK_IMAGE_HEIGHT,bhmust be non-zero.
            To also enableGL_UNPACK_SKIP_IMAGES,bdmust be non-zero. All parameters must be consistent with the compressed format to produce the desired results. When selecting a sub-rectangle from a compressed image: The value ofGL_UNPACK_SKIP_PIXELSmust be a
                        multiple ofbw; the value ofGL_UNPACK_SKIP_ROWSmust be a

                        maps to an area greater than one texture element.
                        There are six defined minifying functions.
                        Two of them use the nearest one or nearest four texture elements
                        to compute the texture value.
                        The other four use mipmaps. A mipmap is an ordered set of arrays representing the same image
                        at progressively lower resolutions.

                        with dimensions2n×2m.
                        Each subsequent mipmap has dimensions2k-1×2l-1,

                                        to produce a texture value from each mipmap.
                                        The final texture value is a weighted average of those two values. Chooses the two mipmaps that most closely match the size of the pixel

                                        The final texture value is a weighted average of those two values. As more texture elements are sampled in the minification process,
                        fewer aliasing artifacts will be apparent.
                        While theGL_NEARESTandGL_LINEARminification functions can be
                        faster than the other four,
                        they sample only one or four texture elements to determine the texture value
                        of the pixel being rendered and can produce moire patterns
                        or ragged transitions.
                        The initial value ofGL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTERisGL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR. The texture magnification function is used when the pixel being textured
                        maps to an area less than or equal to one texture element.
                        It sets the texture magnification function to eitherGL_NEARESTorGL_LINEAR(see below).GL_NEARESTis generally faster
                        thanGL_LINEAR,
                        but it can produce textured images with sharper edges
                        because the transition between texture elements is not as smooth.
                        The initial value ofGL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTERisGL_LINEAR. Returns the value of the texture element that is nearest
                                        (in Manhattan distance)

                                        that are closest to the center of the pixel being textured.
                                        These can include border texture elements,
                                        depending on the values ofGL_TEXTURE_WRAP_SandGL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T,

            is combined with a pixel already in the framebuffer (the ''destination''
            color).  These functions specify one blend equation for the RGB-color
            components and one blend equation for the alpha component.glBlendEquationSeparateispecifies the blend equations for a single draw buffer whereasglBlendEquationSeparatesets the blend equations for all draw buffers. The blend equations use the source and destination blend factors
            specified by eitherglBlendFuncorglBlendFuncSeparate.
            SeeglBlendFuncorglBlendFuncSeparatefor a description of the various blend factors. In the equations that follow, source and destination
            color components are referred to asRsGsBsAsandRdGdBdAd,

            The source and destination blend factors are denotedsRsGsBsAanddRdGdBdA,
            respectively.
            For these equations all color components are understood to have values
            in the range01. The results of these equations are clamped to the range01. TheGL_MINandGL_MAXequations are useful for applications

/**
 * @brief perform a raw data copy between two images
 *
 * glCopyImageSubDatamay be used to copy data from
            one image (i.e. texture or renderbuffer) to another.glCopyImageSubDatadoes not perform general-purpose conversions
            such as scaling, resizing, blending, color-space, or format
            conversions. It should be considered to operate in a manner
            similar to a CPU memcpy. CopyImageSubData can copy between
            images with different internal formats, provided
            the formats are compatible. glCopyImageSubDataalso allows copying between certain
            types of compressed and uncompressed internal formats. This copy does not perform on-the-fly compression
            or decompression. When copying from an uncompressed internal format
            to a compressed internal format, each texel of uncompressed data
            becomes a single block of compressed data. When copying from a
            compressed internal format to an uncompressed internal format,
            a block of compressed data becomes a single texel of uncompressed
            data. The texel size of the uncompressed format must be the same
            size the block size of the compressed formats. Thus it is permitted
            to copy between a 128-bit uncompressed format and a compressed
            format which uses 8-bit 4x4 blocks, or between a 64-bit uncompressed
            format and a compressed format which uses 4-bit 4x4 blocks. The source object is identified bysrcNameandsrcTargetand the destination object is identified
            bydstNameanddstTarget.
            The interpretation of the name depends on the value
            of the correspondingtargetparameter.
            IftargetisGL_RENDERBUFFER, the name is interpreted as the name of a
            renderbuffer object.  If the target parameter is a texture target,
            the name is interpreted as a texture object.  All non-proxy
            texture targets are accepted, with the exception ofGL_TEXTURE_BUFFERand the cubemap face selectors. srcLevelanddstLevelidentify the source and destination
            level of detail.  For textures, this must be a valid level of
            detail in the texture object.  For renderbuffers, this value must
            be zero. srcX,srcY, andsrcZspecify the lower left texel
            coordinates of asrcWidth-wide bysrcHeight-high bysrcDepth-deep rectangular subregion of the source texel array.
            Similarly,dstX,dstYanddstZspecify the coordinates of a subregion of the
            destination texel array.  The source and destination subregions
            must be contained entirely within the specified level of the
            corresponding image objects. The dimensions are always specified in texels, even for compressed
            texture formats. However, it should be noted that if only one of the
            source and destination textures is compressed then the number of
            texels touched in the compressed image will be a factor of the
            block size larger than in the uncompressed image. Slices of aGL_TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY,GL_TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY,GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_ARRAYGL_TEXTURE_3Dand faces ofGL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAPare all compatible provided
            they share a compatible internal format, and multiple slices or faces
            may be copied between these objects with a single call by specifying the
            starting slice withsrcZanddstZ, and the number of slices to
            be copied withsrcDepth.  Cubemap textures always have six faces
            which are selected by a zero-based face index. For the purposes of CopyImageSubData, two internal formats are considered compatible if
            any of the following conditions are met: the formats are the same, the formats are considered compatible according
                        to the compatibility rules used for texture
                        views as defined in section 3.9.X. In
                        particular, if both internal formats are listed
                        in the same entry of Table 3.X.2, they are
                        considered compatible, or one format is compressed and the other is
                        uncompressed and Table 4.X.1 lists the two

    prior to this call. The following parameter values can be retrieved withglGetVertexArrayIndexedivfor each of the attributes
    defined for a vertex array object: GL_VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_ENABLED:paramreturns a value that is non-zero (true)
          if the vertex attribute array for index is enabled and 0 (false) if
          it is disabled. The initial value isGL_FALSE. GL_VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_SIZE:paramreturns a single value, the size of the
          vertex attribute array for index. The size is the number of values
          for each element of the vertex attribute array, and it will be 1, 2,
          3 or 4. The initial value is 4. GL_VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_STRIDE:paramreturns a single value, the array
          stride for (number of bytes between successive elements in) the
          vertex attribute array for index. A value of 0 indicates the array
          elements are stored sequentially in memory. The initial value is
          0. GL_VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_TYPE:paramreturns a single value, a symbolic
          constant indicating the array type for the vertex attribute array
          for index. Possible values areGL_BYTE,GL_DOUBLE,GL_FIXED,GL_FLOAT,GL_HALF_FLOAT,GL_INT,GL_INT_2_10_10_10_REV,GL_SHORT,GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE,GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT,GL_UNSIGNED_INT,GL_UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV, andGL_UNSIGNED_INT_10F_11F_11F_REV. The initial

          indicated by index have integer data type, and 0 (false) otherwise.
          The initial value is 0 (GL_FALSE). GL_VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_LONG:paramreturns a single value that is non-zero
          (true) if a vertex attribute is stored as an unconverted double, and
          0 (false) otherwise. The initial value is 0
          (GL_FALSE). GL_VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_DIVISOR:paramreturns a single value that is the
          frequency divisor used for instanced rendering. See
          glVertexAttribDivisor. The initial value is 0. GL_VERTEX_ATTRIB_RELATIVE_OFFSET:paramreturns a single value that is the byte
          offset of the first element relative to the start of the vertex
          buffer binding specified attribute fetches from. The initial value
          is 0. glGetVertexArrayIndexed64ivcan be

            color component, anddstAlphaspecifies which method is used to scale the
            destination alpha component.
            The possible methods are described in the following table.
            Each method defines four scale factors,
            one each for red, green, blue, and alpha. In the table and in subsequent equations, first source, second source and destination
            color components are referred to asRs0Gs0Bs0As0,Rs1Gs1Bs1As1,
            andRdGdBdAd, respectively.
            The color specified byglBlendColoris referred to asRcGcBcAc.
            They are understood to have integer values between 0 andkRkGkBkA,
            where kc=2mc-1 andmRmGmBmAis the number of red,

            and alpha bitplanes. Source and destination scale factors are referred to assRsGsBsAanddRdGdBdA.
            All scale factors have range01. In the table, i=min⁡As1-Ad To determine the blended RGBA values of a pixel,
            the system uses the following equations: Rd=min⁡kRRs⁢sR+Rd⁢dRGd=min⁡kGGs⁢sG+Gd⁢dGBd=min⁡kBBs⁢sB+Bd⁢dBAd=min⁡kAAs⁢sA+Ad⁢dA Despite the apparent precision of the above equations, blending arithmetic
            is not exactly specified, because blending operates with imprecise integer
            color values.  However, a blend factor that should be equal to 1 is
            guaranteed not to modify its multiplicand, and a blend factor equal to 0
            reduces its multiplicand to 0.  For example, whensrcRGBisGL_SRC_ALPHA,dstRGBisGL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA, andAsis

                        texture's internal format and substituted for the non-existent texel data. If the texture contains depth
                        components, the first component ofGL_TEXTURE_BORDER_COLORis interpreted as a depth value.

                        parameter for the texture before texture sampling. The specified value is added to the shader-supplied
                        bias value (if any) and subsequently clamped into the implementation-defined range-biasmaxbiasmax,
                        wherebiasmaxis the value of the implementation defined constantGL_MAX_TEXTURE_LOD_BIAS. The initial value is 0.0. The texture minifying function is used whenever the level-of-detail function

                        to compute the texture value.
                        The other four use mipmaps. A mipmap is an ordered set of arrays representing the same image
                        at progressively lower resolutions.

                                        The final texture value is a weighted average of those two values. As more texture elements are sampled in the minification process,
                        fewer aliasing artifacts will be apparent.
                        While theGL_NEARESTandGL_LINEARminification functions can be
                        faster than the other four,
                        they sample only one or multiple texture elements to determine the texture value
                        of the pixel being rendered and can produce moire patterns
                        or ragged transitions.
                        The initial value ofGL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTERisGL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR. The texture magnification function is used whenever the level-of-detail function
                        used when sampling from the texture determines that the texture should be magified.
                        It sets the texture magnification function to eitherGL_NEARESTorGL_LINEAR(see below).GL_NEARESTis generally faster
                        thanGL_LINEAR,
                        but it can produce textured images with sharper edges
                        because the transition between texture elements is not as smooth.
                        The initial value ofGL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTERisGL_LINEAR. Returns the value of the texture element that is nearest
                                        (in Manhattan distance)
                                        to the specified texture coordinates. Returns the weighted average of the texture elements
                                        that are closest to the specified texture coordinates.
                                        These can include items wrapped or repeated from other parts of a texture,
                                        depending on the values ofGL_TEXTURE_WRAP_SandGL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T,
                                        and on the exact mapping. Sets the minimum level-of-detail parameter.  This floating-point value
                        limits the selection of highest resolution mipmap (lowest mipmap

                        Setting the value ofGL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_RGBAis equivalent (assuming no errors are generated) to
                        setting the parameters of each ofGL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R,GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_G,GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_B, andGL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_Asuccessively.

/**
 * @brief specify a three-dimensional texture subimage
 *
 * Texturing maps a portion of a specified texture image
            onto each graphical primitive for which texturing is enabled. glTexSubImage3DandglTextureSubImage3Dredefine a contiguous
            subregion of an existing three-dimensional or two-dimensioanl
            array texture image.
            The texels referenced bypixelsreplace the portion of the
            existing texture array with x indicesxoffsetandxoffset+width-1,
            inclusive,

            inclusive,
            and z indiceszoffsetandzoffset+depth-1,
            inclusive.
            For three-dimensional textures, the z index refers to the third
            dimension. For two-dimensional array textures, the z index refers to
            the slice index.
            This region may not include any texels outside the range of the
            texture array as it was originally specified.
            It is not an error to specify a subtexture with zero width, height, or
            depth but such a specification has no effect. If a non-zero named buffer object is bound to theGL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFERtarget
            (seeglBindBuffer) while a texture image is
            specified,pixelsis treated as a byte offset into the buffer object's data store.

    accommodated with mipmaps but a long skinny texture, or a texture without
    mipmaps may easily fit in texture memory. The proxy targets allow the user
    to more accurately query whether the GL can accommodate a texture of a
    given configuration. If the texture cannot be accommodated, the texture
    state variables, which may be queried withglGetTexLevelParameterandglGetTextureLevelParameter, are set to 0. If the

          The resolution chosen by the GL will be a close match for the
          resolution requested by the user with the component argument ofglTexImage1D,glTexImage2D,glTexImage3D,glCopyTexImage1D, andglCopyTexImage2D. The initial value is 0. paramsreturns a single boolean value
          indicating if the texture image is stored in a compressed internal

/**
 * @brief creates and initializes a buffer object's immutable data
    store
 *
 * glBufferStorageandglNamedBufferStoragecreate a new immutable data
    store. ForglBufferStorage, the buffer object
    currently bound totargetwill be initialized. ForglNamedBufferStorage,bufferis the name of the buffer object that will be configured. The size of the
    data store is specified bysize. If an initial data
    is available, its address may be supplied indata.
    Otherwise, to create an uninitialized data store,datashould beNULL. Theflagsparameters specifies the intended
    usage of the buffer's data store. It must be a bitwise combination of a
    subset of the following flags: The contents of the data store may be updated after creation
            through calls toglBufferSubData. If this bit is not set, the buffer content may
            not be directly updated by the client. The data argument may be
            used to specify the initial content of the buffer's data store
            regardless of the presence of theGL_DYNAMIC_STORAGE_BIT. Regardless of the
            presence of this bit, buffers may always be updated with
            server-side calls such asglCopyBufferSubDataandglClearBufferSubData. The data store may be mapped by the client for read access
            and a pointer in the client's address space obtained that may be
            read from. The data store may be mapped by the client for write access
            and a pointer in the client's address space obtained that may be
            written through. The client may request that the server read from or write to
            the buffer while it is mapped. The client's pointer to the data
            store remains valid so long as the data store is mapped, even
            during execution of drawing or dispatch commands. Shared access to buffers that are simultaneously mapped for
            client access and are used by the server will be coherent, so long
            as that mapping is performed usingglMapBufferRange. That is, data written to the store by either
            the client or server will be immediately visible to the other with
            no further action taken by the application. In particular, IfGL_MAP_COHERENT_BITis not set
                and the client performs a write followed by a call to theglMemoryBarriercommand with theGL_CLIENT_MAPPED_BUFFER_BARRIER_BITset,
                then in subsequent commands the server will see the
                writes. IfGL_MAP_COHERENT_BITis set and
                the client performs a write, then in subsequent commands the
                server will see the writes. IfGL_MAP_COHERENT_BITis not set
                and the server performs a write, the application must callglMemoryBarrierwith theGL_CLIENT_MAPPED_BUFFER_BARRIER_BITset
                and then callglFenceSyncwithGL_SYNC_GPU_COMMANDS_COMPLETE(orglFinish). Then the CPU will see the
                writes after the sync is complete. IfGL_MAP_COHERENT_BITis set and
                the server does a write, the app must call FenceSync withGL_SYNC_GPU_COMMANDS_COMPLETE(orglFinish). Then the CPU will see the writes after the
                sync is complete. When all other criteria for the buffer storage allocation
            are met, this bit may be used by an implementation to determine
            whether to use storage that is local to the server or to the
            client to serve as the backing store for the buffer. The allowed combinations of flags are subject to certain
    restrictions. They are as follows: IfflagscontainsGL_MAP_PERSISTENT_BIT, it must also contain at
          least one ofGL_MAP_READ_BITorGL_MAP_WRITE_BIT. IfflagscontainsGL_MAP_COHERENT_BIT, it must also containGL_MAP_PERSISTENT_BIT.

/**
 * @brief specify a one-dimensional texture image
 *
 * Texturing maps a portion of a specified texture image
            onto each graphical primitive for which texturing is enabled.
            To enable and disable one-dimensional texturing, callglEnableandglDisablewith argumentGL_TEXTURE_1D. Texture images are defined withglTexImage1D.
            The arguments describe the parameters of the texture image,
            such as width,
            width of the border,
            level-of-detail number
            (seeglTexParameter),
            and the internal resolution and format used to store the image.
            The last three arguments describe how the image is represented in
            memory. IftargetisGL_PROXY_TEXTURE_1D, no data is read fromdata, but
            all of the texture image state is recalculated, checked for
            consistency, and checked against the implementation's capabilities.
            If the implementation cannot handle a texture of the
            requested texture size, it sets all of the image state to 0,
            but does not generate an error (seeglGetError). To query for an
            entire mipmap array, use an image array level greater than or equal to
            1. IftargetisGL_TEXTURE_1D,
            data is read fromdataas a sequence of signed or unsigned bytes,
            shorts,
            or longs,
            or single-precision floating-point values,
            depending ontype.
            These values are grouped into sets of one,
            two,
            three,
            or four values,
            depending onformat,
            to form elements.
            Each data byte is treated as eight 1-bit elements,
            with bit ordering determined byGL_UNPACK_LSB_FIRST(seeglPixelStore). If a non-zero named buffer object is bound to theGL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFERtarget
            (seeglBindBuffer) while a texture image is
            specified,datais treated as a byte offset into the buffer object's data store. The first element corresponds to the left end of the texture array.
            Subsequent elements progress left-to-right through the remaining texels
            in the texture array.
            The final element corresponds to the right end of the texture array. formatdetermines the composition of each element indata.
            It can assume one of these symbolic values: Each element is a single red component.
                        The GL converts it to floating point and assembles it into an RGBA element
                        by attaching 0 for green and blue, and 1 for alpha.
                        Each component is clamped to the range [0,1]. Each element is a single red/green double
                        The GL converts it to floating point and assembles it into an RGBA element
                        by attaching 0 for blue, and 1 for alpha.
                        Each component is clamped to the range [0,1]. Each element is an RGB triple.
                        The GL converts it to floating point and assembles it into an RGBA element
                        by attaching 1 for alpha.
                        Each component is clamped to the range [0,1]. Each element contains all four components.
                        Each component clamped to the range [0,1]. Each element is a single depth value.
                        The GL converts it to floating point and clamps to the range [0,1]. If an application wants to store the texture at a certain
            resolution or in a certain format, it can request the resolution
            and format withinternalFormat. The GL will choose an internal
            representation that closely approximates that requested byinternalFormat, but
            it may not match exactly.
            (The representations specified byGL_RED,GL_RG,GL_RGBandGL_RGBAmust match exactly.) internalFormatmay be one of the base internal formats shown in
            Table 1, below internalFormatmay also be one of the sized internal formats
            shown in Table 2, below Finally,internalFormatmay also be one of the generic or compressed
            compressed texture formats shown in Table 3 below If theinternalFormatparameter is one of the generic compressed formats,GL_COMPRESSED_RED,GL_COMPRESSED_RG,GL_COMPRESSED_RGB, orGL_COMPRESSED_RGBA, the GL will replace the internal format with the symbolic constant for a specific internal format and compress the texture before storage.  If no corresponding internal format is available, or the GL can not compress that image for any reason, the internal format is instead replaced with a corresponding base internal format. If theinternalFormatparameter isGL_SRGB,GL_SRGB8,GL_SRGB_ALPHAorGL_SRGB8_ALPHA8, the texture is treated as if the red, green, or blue components are encoded in the sRGB color space.    Any alpha component is left unchanged.  The conversion from the sRGB encoded componentcsto a linear componentclis: cl={cs12.92ifcs≤0.04045(cs+0.0551.055)2.4ifcs>0.04045 Assumecsis the sRGB component in the range [0,1]. Use theGL_PROXY_TEXTURE_1Dtarget to try out a resolution and
            format. The implementation will
            update and recompute its best match for the requested storage resolution
            and format. To then query this state, callglGetTexLevelParameter.
            If the texture cannot be accommodated, texture state is set to 0. A one-component texture image uses only the red component of the RGBA
            color fromdata.
            A two-component image uses the R and A values.
            A three-component image uses the R, G, and B values.
            A four-component image uses all of the RGBA components. Image-based shadowing can be enabled by comparing texture r coordinates to depth texture values to generate a boolean result.  SeeglTexParameterfor details on texture comparison.

            the name string associated with an active variable, interface block, or
            subroutine is written toparams.  The name length includes a terminating
            null character. For the propertyGL_TYPE, a single integer identifying the type of an active
            variable is written toparams.  The integer returned is one of the
            values found in table 2.16. For the propertyGL_ARRAY_SIZE, a single integer identifying the number of
            active array elements of an active variable is written toparams.  The
            array size returned is in units of the type associated with the propertyGL_TYPE.  For active variables not corresponding to an array of basic types,
            the value zero is written toparams. For the propertyGL_BLOCK_INDEX, a single integer identifying the index of
            the active interface block containing an active variable is written toparams.  If the variable is not the member of an interface block, the
            value -1 is written toparams. For the propertyGL_OFFSET, a single integer identifying the offset of an
            active variable is written toparams.  For variables in theGL_UNIFORMandGL_BUFFER_VARIABLEinterfaces that are backed by a buffer object, the value
            written is the offset of that variable relative to the base of the buffer
            range holding its value.  For variables in theGL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_VARYINGinterface, the value written is the offset in the transform feedback
            buffer storage assigned to each vertex captured in transform feedback mode
            where the value of the variable will be stored.  Such offsets are
            specified via thexfb_offsetlayout qualifier or assigned according to
            the variables position in the list of strings passed toglTransformFeedbackVaryings.  Offsets are expressed in basic machine units.

            special names"gl_NextBuffer","gl_SkipComponents1","gl_SkipComponents2","gl_SkipComponents3", and"gl_SkipComponents4", -1 is written toparams. For the propertyGL_ARRAY_STRIDE, a single integer identifying the stride
            between array elements in an active variable is written toparams.  For
            active variables declared as an array of basic types, the value written is
            the difference, in basic machine units, between the offsets of consecutive
            elements in an array.  For active variables not declared as an array of
            basic types, zero is written toparams.  For active variables not backed
            by a buffer object, -1 is written toparams, regardless of the variable
            type. For the propertyGL_MATRIX_STRIDE, a single integer identifying the stride
            between columns of a column-major matrix or rows of a row-major matrix is
            written toparams.  For active variables declared a single matrix or
            array of matrices, the value written is the difference, in basic machine
            units, between the offsets of consecutive columns or rows in each matrix.
            For active variables not declared as a matrix or array of matrices, zero
            is written toparams.  For active variables not backed by a buffer
            object, -1 is written toparams, regardless of the variable type. For the propertyGL_IS_ROW_MAJOR, a single integer identifying whether an
            active variable is a row-major matrix is written toparams.  For active
            variables backed by a buffer object, declared as a single matrix or array
            of matrices, and stored in row-major order, one is written toparams.
            For all other active variables, zero is written toparams. For the propertyGL_ATOMIC_COUNTER_BUFFER_INDEX, a single integer identifying
            the index of the active atomic counter buffer containing an active
            variable is written toparams.  If the variable is not an atomic counter
            uniform, the value -1 is written toparams. For the propertyGL_BUFFER_BINDING, to index of the buffer binding point
            associated with the active uniform block, shader storage block, atomic
            counter buffer or transform feedback buffer is written toparams. For the propertyGL_BUFFER_DATA_SIZE, then the implementation-dependent
            minimum total buffer object size, in basic machine units, required to hold
            all active variables associated with an active uniform block, shader
            storage block, or atomic counter buffer is written toparams.  If the
            final member of an active shader storage block is array with no declared
            size, the minimum buffer size is computed assuming the array was declared
            as an array with one element. For the propertyGL_NUM_ACTIVE_VARIABLES, the number of active variables
            associated with an active uniform block, shader storage block, atomic
            counter buffer or transform feedback buffer is written toparams. For the propertyGL_ACTIVE_VARIABLES, an array of active variable indices
            associated with an active uniform block, shader storage block, atomic
            counter buffer or transform feedback buffer is written toparams.  The number of values written toparamsfor an active resource is given by the value of the propertyGL_NUM_ACTIVE_VARIABLESfor the resource. For the propertiesGL_REFERENCED_BY_VERTEX_SHADER,GL_REFERENCED_BY_TESS_CONTROL_SHADER,GL_REFERENCED_BY_TESS_EVALUATION_SHADER,GL_REFERENCED_BY_GEOMETRY_SHADER,GL_REFERENCED_BY_FRAGMENT_SHADER, andGL_REFERENCED_BY_COMPUTE_SHADER, a single integer is written toparams,
            identifying whether the active resource is referenced by the vertex,
            tessellation control, tessellation evaluation, geometry, or fragment
            shaders, respectively, in the program object.  The value one is written toparamsif an active variable is referenced by the corresponding shader,
            or if an active uniform block, shader storage block, or atomic counter
            buffer contains at least one variable referenced by the corresponding
            shader.  Otherwise, the value zero is written toparams. For the propertyGL_TOP_LEVEL_ARRAY_SIZE, a single integer identifying the
            number of active array elements of the top-level shader storage block
            member containing to the active variable is written toparams.  If the
            top-level block member is not declared as an array, the value one is
            written toparams.  If the top-level block member is an array with no
            declared size, the value zero is written toparams. For the propertyGL_TOP_LEVEL_ARRAY_STRIDE, a single integer identifying the
            stride between array elements of the top-level shader storage block member
            containing the active variable is written toparams.  For top-level
            block members declared as arrays, the value written is the difference, in
            basic machine units, between the offsets of the active variable for
            consecutive elements in the top-level array.  For top-level block members
            not declared as an array, zero is written toparams. For the propertyGL_LOCATION, a single integer identifying the assigned
            location for an active uniform, input, output, or subroutine uniform
            variable is written toparams.  For input, output, or uniform variables
            with locations specified by a layout qualifier, the specified location is
            used.  For vertex shader input or fragment shader output variables without
            a layout qualifier, the location assigned when a program is linked is
            written toparams.  For all other input and output variables, the value
            -1 is written toparams.  For uniforms in uniform blocks, the value -1
            is written toparams. For the propertyGL_LOCATION_INDEX, a single integer identifying the fragment
            color index of an active fragment shader output variable is written toparams.  If the active variable is an output for a non-fragment shader,
            the value -1 will be written toparams. For the propertyGL_IS_PER_PATCH, a single integer identifying whether the
            input or output is a per-patch attribute.  If the active variable is a
            per-patch attribute (declared with thepatchqualifier), the value one
            is written toparams; otherwise, the value zero is written toparams. For the propertyGL_LOCATION_COMPONENT, a single integer indicating the first

/**
 * @brief bind a named buffer object
 *
 * glBindBufferbinds a buffer object to the specified buffer binding point. CallingglBindBufferwithtargetset to one of the accepted symbolic constants andbufferset to the name
            of a buffer object binds that buffer object name to the target. If no buffer object with namebufferexists, one is created with that name. When a buffer object is bound to a target, the previous binding for that
            target is automatically broken. Buffer object names are unsigned integers. The value zero is reserved, but
            there is no default buffer object for each buffer object target. Instead,bufferset to zero
            effectively unbinds any buffer object previously bound, and restores client memory usage for that buffer object target (if supported for that target).
            Buffer object names and the corresponding buffer object contents are local to
            the shared object space of the current
            GL rendering context;
            two rendering contexts share buffer object names only if they
            explicitly enable sharing between contexts through the appropriate GL windows interfaces functions. glGenBuffersmust be used to generate a set of unused buffer object names. The state of a buffer object immediately after it is first bound is an unmapped zero-sized memory buffer withGL_READ_WRITEaccess andGL_STATIC_DRAWusage. While a non-zero buffer object name is bound, GL operations on the target to which it is
            bound affect the bound buffer object, and queries of the target to which it is bound return state
            from the bound buffer object. While buffer object name zero is bound, as in the initial state,
            attempts to modify or query state on the target to which it is bound generates anGL_INVALID_OPERATIONerror. When a non-zero buffer object is bound to theGL_ARRAY_BUFFERtarget,
            the vertex array pointer parameter is interpreted as an offset within the

            parameters for draws issued throughglDrawArraysIndirectandglDrawElementsIndirectare sourced
            from the specified offset in that buffer object's data store. When a non-zero buffer object is bound to theGL_DISPATCH_INDIRECT_BUFFERtarget,
            the parameters for compute dispatches issued throughglDispatchComputeIndirectare sourced from the specified offset in that buffer object's data store. While a non-zero buffer object is bound to theGL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFERtarget,
            the indices parameter ofglDrawElements,glDrawElementsInstanced,glDrawElementsBaseVertex,glDrawRangeElements,glDrawRangeElementsBaseVertex,glMultiDrawElements, orglMultiDrawElementsBaseVertexis interpreted as an
            offset within the buffer object measured in basic machine units. While a non-zero buffer object is bound to theGL_PIXEL_PACK_BUFFERtarget,
            the following commands are affected:glGetCompressedTexImage,glGetTexImage, andglReadPixels. The pointer parameter is
            interpreted as an offset within the buffer object measured in basic machine units. While a non-zero buffer object is bound to theGL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFERtarget,

The pointer parameter is
            interpreted as an offset within the buffer object measured in basic machine units. The buffer targetsGL_COPY_READ_BUFFERandGL_COPY_WRITE_BUFFERare provided to allowglCopyBufferSubDatato be used without disturbing the state of other bindings. However,glCopyBufferSubDatamay be used with any pair of buffer binding points. TheGL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFERbuffer binding point may be passed toglBindBuffer,
            but will not directly affect transform feedback state. Instead, the indexedGL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFERbindings must be used through a call toglBindBufferBaseorglBindBufferRange. This will affect the genericGL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFERbinding. Likewise, theGL_UNIFORM_BUFFER,GL_ATOMIC_COUNTER_BUFFERandGL_SHADER_STORAGE_BUFFERbuffer binding points may
            be used, but do not directly affect uniform buffer, atomic counter buffer or shader storage buffer state, respectively.glBindBufferBaseorglBindBufferRangemust be used to bind a buffer to
            an indexed uniform buffer, atomic counter buffer or shader storage buffer binding point. TheGL_QUERY_BUFFERbinding point is used to specify a buffer object that is to
            receive the results of query objects through calls to theglGetQueryObjectfamily of commands. A buffer object binding created withglBindBufferremains active until a different
            buffer object name is bound to the same target, or until the bound buffer object is
            deleted withglDeleteBuffers. Once created, a named buffer object may be re-bound to any target as often as needed. However,
            the GL implementation may make choices about how to optimize the storage of a buffer object based
            on its initial binding target.

            When a texture is bound to a target, the previous binding for that target is automatically broken. Texture names are unsigned integers. The value zero is reserved to
            represent the default texture for each texture target.
            Texture names and the corresponding texture contents are local to
            the shared object space of the current GL rendering context;
            two rendering contexts share texture names only if they
            explicitly enable sharing between contexts through the appropriate GL windows interfaces functions. You must useglGenTexturesto generate a set of new texture names. When a texture is first bound, it assumes the specified target:
            A texture first bound toGL_TEXTURE_1Dbecomes one-dimensional texture, a
            texture first bound toGL_TEXTURE_2Dbecomes two-dimensional texture, a
            texture first bound toGL_TEXTURE_3Dbecomes three-dimensional texture, a
            texture first bound toGL_TEXTURE_1D_ARRAYbecomes one-dimensional array texture, a
            texture first bound toGL_TEXTURE_2D_ARRAYbecomes two-dimensional array texture, a
            texture first bound toGL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLEbecomes rectangle texture, a
            texture first bound toGL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAPbecomes a cube-mapped texture, a
            texture first bound toGL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_ARRAYbecomes a cube-mapped array texture, a
            texture first bound toGL_TEXTURE_BUFFERbecomes a buffer texture, a
            texture first bound toGL_TEXTURE_2D_MULTISAMPLEbecomes a two-dimensional multisampled texture, and a
            texture first bound toGL_TEXTURE_2D_MULTISAMPLE_ARRAYbecomes a two-dimensional multisampled array texture.
            The state of a one-dimensional texture immediately after it is first bound is equivalent to the state of the
            defaultGL_TEXTURE_1Dat GL initialization, and similarly for the other texture types. While a texture is bound, GL operations on the target to which it is
            bound affect the bound texture, and queries of the target to which it
            is bound return state from the bound texture.
            In effect, the texture targets become aliases for the textures currently
            bound to them, and the texture name zero refers to the default textures
            that were bound to them at initialization. A texture binding created withglBindTextureremains active until a different
            texture is bound to the same target, or until the bound texture is
            deleted withglDeleteTextures. Once created, a named texture may be re-bound to its same original target as often as needed.
            It is usually much faster to useglBindTextureto bind an existing named

            usingglTexImage1D,glTexImage2D,glTexImage3Dor another similar function.

 * Stenciling,
            like depth-buffering,

            Stencil planes are first drawn into using GL drawing primitives, then
            geometry and images are rendered using the stencil planes to mask out
            portions of the screen.
            Stenciling is typically used in multipass rendering algorithms
            to achieve special effects,
            such as decals,
            outlining,
            and constructive solid geometry rendering. The stencil test conditionally eliminates a pixel based on the outcome
            of a comparison between the reference value
            and the value in the stencil buffer.
            To enable and disable the test, callglEnableandglDisablewith argumentGL_STENCIL_TEST.
            To specify actions based on the outcome of the stencil test, callglStencilOporglStencilOpSeparate. There can be two separate sets offunc,ref, andmaskparameters; one affects back-facing polygons, and the other
            affects front-facing polygons as well as other non-polygon primitives.glStencilFuncsets both front

ForglGetTextureImage,texturespecifies the texture object name. In addition to types of textures
    accepted byglGetTexImageandglGetnTexImage, the function also accepts cube map
    texture objects (with effective targetGL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP).levelspecifies the level-of-detail number of the desired image.formatandtypespecify the
    format and type of the desired image array. See the reference page forglTexImage1Dfor a description of the acceptable values for theformatandtypeparameters,
    respectively. For glGetnTexImage and glGetTextureImage functions, bufSize
    tells the size of the buffer to receive the retrieved pixel data.glGetnTexImageandglGetTextureImagedo not write more thanbufSizebytes intopixels. If a non-zero named buffer object is bound to theGL_PIXEL_PACK_BUFFERtarget (seeglBindBuffer) while a texture image is requested,pixelsis treated as a byte offset into the buffer
    object's data store. To understand the operation ofglGetTexImage,
    consider the selected internal four-component texture image to be an RGBA
    color buffer the size of the image. The semantics ofglGetTexImageare then identical to those ofglReadPixels, with the exception that no pixel transfer operations
    are performed, when called with the sameformatandtype, withxandyset to 0,widthset to the
    width of the texture image andheightset to 1 for 1D
    images, or to the height of the texture image for 2D images. If the selected texture image does not contain four components, the
    following mappings are applied. Single-component textures are treated as
    RGBA buffers with red set to the single-component value, green set to 0,
    blue set to 0, and alpha set to 1. Two-component textures are treated as
    RGBA buffers with red set to the value of component zero, alpha set to the
    value of component one, and green and blue set to 0. Finally,
    three-component textures are treated as RGBA buffers with red set to
    component zero, green set to component one, blue set to component two, and
    alpha set to 1. To determine the required size ofpixels, useglGetTexLevelParameterto determine the dimensions of the internal texture
    image, then scale the required number of pixels by the storage required
    for each pixel, based onformatandtype. Be sure to take the pixel storage parameters
    into account, especiallyGL_PACK_ALIGNMENT. IfglGetTextureImageis used against a cube map
    texture object, the texture is treated as a three-dimensional image of a
    depth of 6, where the cube map faces are ordered as image layers, in an
    order presented in the table below:

    buffer, starting with the pixel whose lower left corner is at location
    (x,y), into client memory
    starting at locationdata. Several parameters
    control the processing of the pixel data before it is placed into client
    memory. These parameters are set withglPixelStore. This reference page describes the effects onglReadPixelsandglReadnPixelsof most, but not all of the parameters specified by these three
    commands. If a non-zero named buffer object is bound to theGL_PIXEL_PACK_BUFFERtarget (seeglBindBuffer) while a block of pixels is requested,datais treated as a byte offset into the buffer
    object's data store rather than a pointer to client memory. glReadPixelsandglReadnPixelsreturn values from each pixel with
    lower left corner atx+iy+jfor0<=i<widthand0<=j<height.
            This pixel is said to be theith
            pixel in thejth
            row.
            Pixels are returned in row order from the lowest to the highest row,
            left to right in each row. formatspecifies the format for the returned pixel values;
            accepted values are: Stencil values are read from the stencil buffer. Depth values are read from the depth buffer.
                        Each component is converted to floating point such that the minimum depth
                        value maps to 0 and the maximum value maps to 1.
                        Each component is clamped to the range01. Values are taken from both the depth and stencil buffers. Thetypeparameter
                        must beGL_UNSIGNED_INT_24_8orGL_FLOAT_32_UNSIGNED_INT_24_8_REV. Color values are taken from the color buffer. Finally, the indices or components
            are converted to the proper format,
            as specified bytype.
            IfformatisGL_STENCIL_INDEXandtypeis notGL_FLOAT,
            each index is masked with the mask value given in the following table.
            IftypeisGL_FLOAT, then each integer index is converted to
            single-precision floating-point format. IfformatisGL_RED,GL_GREEN,GL_BLUE,GL_RGB,GL_BGR,GL_RGBA, orGL_BGRAandtypeis notGL_FLOAT,
            each component is multiplied by the multiplier shown in the following table.
            If type isGL_FLOAT, then each component is passed as is
            (or converted to the client's single-precision floating-point format if
            it is different from the one used by the GL). Return values are placed in memory as follows.
            IfformatisGL_STENCIL_INDEX,GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT,GL_RED,GL_GREEN, orGL_BLUE,
            a single value is returned and the data for theith
            pixel in thejth
            row
            is placed in locationj⁢width+i.GL_RGBandGL_BGRreturn three values,GL_RGBAandGL_BGRAreturn four
    values for each pixel, with all values corresponding to a single pixel
    occupying contiguous space indata. Storage
    parameters set byglPixelStore, such asGL_PACK_LSB_FIRSTandGL_PACK_SWAP_BYTES, affect the way that data is
    written into memory. SeeglPixelStorefor a description. glReadnPixelsfunction will only handle the

/**
 * @brief Specify the value of a uniform variable for the current program object
 *
 * glUniformmodifies the value of a
    uniform variable or a uniform variable array. The location of
    the uniform variable to be modified is specified bylocation, which should be a value
    returned byglGetUniformLocation.glUniformoperates on the program object
    that was made part of current state by callingglUseProgram. The commandsglUniform{1|2|3|4}{f|i|ui}are used to change the value of the uniform variable specified
    bylocationusing the values passed as
    arguments. The number specified in the command should match the
    number of components in the data type of the specified uniform
    variable (e.g.,1forfloat,int,unsigned int,bool;2forvec2,ivec2,uvec2,bvec2, etc.). The suffixfindicates that floating-point values are
    being passed; the suffixiindicates that
    integer values are being passed; the suffixuiindicates that
    unsigned integer values are being passed, and this type should also match
    the data type of the specified uniform variable. Theivariants of this function should be used
    to provide values for uniform variables defined asint,ivec2,ivec3,ivec4, or arrays of these. Theuivariants of this function should be used
    to provide values for uniform variables defined asunsigned int,uvec2,uvec3,uvec4, or arrays of these. Thefvariants should be used to provide values for uniform variables
    of typefloat,vec2,vec3,vec4, or arrays of these. Either thei,uiorfvariants
    may be used to provide values for uniform variables of typebool,bvec2,bvec3,bvec4, or arrays of these. The uniform
    variable will be set tofalseif the input value is 0 or 0.0f,
    and it will be set totrueotherwise. All active uniform variables defined in a program object
    are initialized to 0 when the program object is linked
    successfully. They retain the values assigned to them by a call
    toglUniformuntil the next successful
    link operation occurs on the program object, when they are once
    again initialized to 0. The commandsglUniform{1|2|3|4}{f|i|ui}vcan be used to modify a single uniform variable or a uniform
    variable array. These commands pass a count and a pointer to the
    values to be loaded into a uniform variable or a uniform
    variable array. A count of 1 should be used if modifying the
    value of a single uniform variable, and a count of 1 or greater
    can be used to modify an entire array or part of an array. When
    loadingnelements starting at an arbitrary
    positionmin a uniform variable array,
    elementsm+n- 1 in
    the array will be replaced with the new values. Ifm+n- 1 is
    larger than the size of the uniform variable array, values for
    all array elements beyond the end of the array will be ignored.
    The number specified in the name of the command indicates the
    number of components for each element invalue, and it should match the number of
    components in the data type of the specified uniform variable
    (e.g.,1for float, int, bool;2for vec2, ivec2, bvec2, etc.). The data
    type specified in the name of the command must match the data
    type for the specified uniform variable as described previously
    forglUniform{1|2|3|4}{f|i|ui}. For uniform variable arrays, each element of the array is
    considered to be of the type indicated in the name of the
    command (e.g.,glUniform3forglUniform3fvcan be used to load a uniform
    variable array of type vec3). The number of elements of the
    uniform variable array to be modified is specified bycount The commandsglUniformMatrix{2|3|4|2x3|3x2|2x4|4x2|3x4|4x3}fvare used to modify a matrix or an array of matrices. The numbers in the
    command name are interpreted as the dimensionality of the matrix.
    The number2indicates a 2 × 2 matrix
    (i.e., 4 values), the number3indicates a
    3 × 3 matrix (i.e., 9 values), and the number4indicates a 4 × 4 matrix (i.e., 16
    values). Non-square matrix dimensionality is explicit, with the first
    number representing the number of columns and the second number
    representing the number of rows.  For example,2x4indicates a 2 × 4 matrix with 2 columns
    and 4 rows (i.e., 8 values).
    IftransposeisGL_FALSE, each matrix is assumed to be
    supplied in column major order. IftransposeisGL_TRUE, each matrix is assumed to be
    supplied in row major order. Thecountargument indicates the number of matrices to be passed. A count
    of 1 should be used if modifying the value of a single matrix,
    and a count greater than 1 can be used to modify an array of
    matrices.

 * @param location Specifies the location of the uniform variable
            to be modified.
 * @param count For the vector (glUniform*v) commands,
                specifies the number of elements that are to be modified.

                array, and 1 or more if it is an array.For the matrix (glUniformMatrix*)
                commands, specifies the number of matrices that are to be

                is not an array of matrices, and 1 or more if it is an array
                of matrices.

                matrix as the values are loaded into the uniform variable.
 * @param v0 For the scalar commands, specifies the new values to be used
                for the specified uniform variable.

            The possible methods are described in the following table.
            Each method defines four scale factors,
            one each for red, green, blue, and alpha.
            In the table and in subsequent equations, first source, second source

            All scale factors have range01. In the table, i=min⁡AskA-AdkA To determine the blended RGBA values of a pixel,
            the system uses the following equations: Rd=min⁡kRRs⁢sR+Rd⁢dRGd=min⁡kGGs⁢sG+Gd⁢dGBd=min⁡kBBs⁢sB+Bd⁢dBAd=min⁡kAAs⁢sA+Ad⁢dA Despite the apparent precision of the above equations,
            blending arithmetic is not exactly specified,
            because blending operates with imprecise integer color values.
            However,
            a blend factor that should be equal to 1
            is guaranteed not to modify its multiplicand,
            and a blend factor equal to 0 reduces its multiplicand to 0.

 * @brief specify a one-dimensional texture image in a compressed format

            one-dimensional texture image iftargetisGL_TEXTURE_1D(seeglTexImage1D). IftargetisGL_PROXY_TEXTURE_1D, no data is read fromdata, but
            all of the texture image state is recalculated, checked for consistency, and checked against the implementation's capabilities.  If the implementation cannot handle a texture of the requested texture size, it sets all of the image state to 0, but does not generate an error (seeglGetError). To query for an entire mipmap array, use an image array level greater than or equal to 1. internalformatmust be an extension-specified compressed-texture format.
            When a texture is loaded withglTexImage1Dusing a generic compressed  texture format
            (e.g.,GL_COMPRESSED_RGB) the GL selects from one of
            its extensions supporting compressed textures.  In order to load the
            compressed texture image usingglCompressedTexImage1D, query the compressed texture image's size and
            format usingglGetTexLevelParameter. If a non-zero named buffer object is bound to theGL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFERtarget
            (seeglBindBuffer) while a texture image is

/**
 * @brief Specify the value of a uniform variable for a specified program object
 *
 * glProgramUniformmodifies the value of a
    uniform variable or a uniform variable array. The location of
    the uniform variable to be modified is specified bylocation, which should be a value
    returned byglGetUniformLocation.glProgramUniformoperates on the program object
    specified byprogram. The commandsglProgramUniform{1|2|3|4}{f|i|ui}are used to change the value of the uniform variable specified
    bylocationusing the values passed as
    arguments. The number specified in the command should match the
    number of components in the data type of the specified uniform
    variable (e.g.,1forfloat,int,unsigned int,bool;2forvec2,ivec2,uvec2,bvec2, etc.). The suffixfindicates that floating-point values are
    being passed; the suffixiindicates that
    integer values are being passed; the suffixuiindicates that
    unsigned integer values are being passed, and this type should also match
    the data type of the specified uniform variable. Theivariants of this function should be used
    to provide values for uniform variables defined asint,ivec2,ivec3,ivec4, or arrays of these. Theuivariants of this function should be used
    to provide values for uniform variables defined asunsigned int,uvec2,uvec3,uvec4, or arrays of these. Thefvariants should be used to provide values for uniform variables
    of typefloat,vec2,vec3,vec4, or arrays of these. Either thei,uiorfvariants
    may be used to provide values for uniform variables of typebool,bvec2,bvec3,bvec4, or arrays of these. The uniform
    variable will be set tofalseif the input value is 0 or 0.0f,
    and it will be set totrueotherwise. All active uniform variables defined in a program object
    are initialized to 0 when the program object is linked
    successfully. They retain the values assigned to them by a call
    toglProgramUniformuntil the next successful
    link operation occurs on the program object, when they are once
    again initialized to 0. The commandsglProgramUniform{1|2|3|4}{f|i|ui}vcan be used to modify a single uniform variable or a uniform
    variable array. These commands pass a count and a pointer to the
    values to be loaded into a uniform variable or a uniform
    variable array. A count of 1 should be used if modifying the
    value of a single uniform variable, and a count of 1 or greater
    can be used to modify an entire array or part of an array. When
    loadingnelements starting at an arbitrary
    positionmin a uniform variable array,
    elementsm+n- 1 in
    the array will be replaced with the new values. Ifm+n- 1 is
    larger than the size of the uniform variable array, values for
    all array elements beyond the end of the array will be ignored.
    The number specified in the name of the command indicates the
    number of components for each element invalue, and it should match the number of
    components in the data type of the specified uniform variable
    (e.g.,1forfloat,int,bool;2forvec2,ivec2,bvec2, etc.). The data
    type specified in the name of the command must match the data
    type for the specified uniform variable as described previously
    forglProgramUniform{1|2|3|4}{f|i|ui}. For uniform variable arrays, each element of the array is
    considered to be of the type indicated in the name of the
    command (e.g.,glProgramUniform3forglProgramUniform3fvcan be used to load a uniform
    variable array of type vec3). The number of elements of the
    uniform variable array to be modified is specified bycount The commandsglProgramUniformMatrix{2|3|4|2x3|3x2|2x4|4x2|3x4|4x3}fvare used to modify a matrix or an array of matrices. The numbers in the
    command name are interpreted as the dimensionality of the matrix.
    The number2indicates a 2 × 2 matrix
    (i.e., 4 values), the number3indicates a
    3 × 3 matrix (i.e., 9 values), and the number4indicates a 4 × 4 matrix (i.e., 16
    values). Non-square matrix dimensionality is explicit, with the first
        number representing the number of columns and the second number
        representing the number of rows.  For example,2x4indicates a 2 × 4 matrix with 2 columns
        and 4 rows (i.e., 8 values).
        IftransposeisGL_FALSE, each matrix is assumed to be
    supplied in column major order. IftransposeisGL_TRUE, each matrix is assumed to be
    supplied in row major order. Thecountargument indicates the number of matrices to be passed. A count
    of 1 should be used if modifying the value of a single matrix,
    and a count greater than 1 can be used to modify an array of
    matrices.

            variable to be modified.
 * @param location Specifies the location of the uniform variable
            to be modified.

                matrices, and 1 or more if it is an array of matrices.
 * @param transpose For the matrix commands, specifies whether to transpose the
                matrix as the values are loaded into the uniform variable.
 * @param v0 For the scalar commands, specifies the new values to be used
                for the specified uniform variable.

 *

            The data can then be directly read and/or written relative to
            the returned pointer, depending on the specifiedaccesspolicy. A pointer to the beginning of the mapped range is returned once
            all pending operations on that buffer object have completed, and
            may be used to modify and/or query the corresponding range of
            the data store according to the value ofaccess: GL_READ_ONLYindicates that
                        the returned pointer may be used to read buffer
                        object data. GL_WRITE_ONLYindicates that
                        the returned pointer may be used to modify buffer
                        object data. GL_READ_WRITEindicates that
                        the returned pointer may be used to read and to
                        modify buffer object data. If an error is generated, aNULLpointer is
            returned. If no error occurs, the returned pointer will reflect an
            allocation aligned to the value ofGL_MIN_MAP_BUFFER_ALIGNMENTbasic machine
            units. The returned pointer values may not be passed as parameter
            values to GL commands. For example, they may not be used to
            specify array pointers, or to specify or query pixel or texture
            image data; such actions produce undefined results, although
            implementations may not check for such behavior for performance
            reasons. No GL error is generated if the returned pointer is accessed in
            a way inconsistent withaccess(e.g. used
            to read from a mapping made withaccessGL_WRITE_ONLYor write to a mapping made
            withaccessGL_READ_ONLY), but the result is undefined
            and system errors (possibly including program termination) may
            occur. Mappings to the data stores of buffer objects may have
            nonstandard performance characteristics. For example, such
            mappings may be marked as uncacheable regions of memory, and in
            such cases reading from them may be very slow. To ensure optimal
            performance, the client should use the mapping in a fashion
            consistent withGL_BUFFER_USAGE(seeglGet*BufferParameterandusageofglBufferData)
            for the buffer object and ofaccess.
            Using a mapping in a fashion inconsistent with these values is liable

            compressed texture image usingglCompressedTexImage3D, query the compressed texture image's
            size and format usingglGetTexLevelParameter. If a non-zero named buffer object is bound to theGL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFERtarget
            (seeglBindBuffer) while a texture image is
            specified,datais treated as a byte offset into the buffer object's data store. If the compressed data are arranged into fixed-size blocks of texels, the pixel
            storage modes can be used to select a sub-rectangle from a larger containing rectangle.
            These pixel storage modes operate in the same way as they do forglTexImage1D.
            In the following description, denote bybs,bw,bh, andbdthe values of pixel storage modesGL_UNPACK_COMPRESSED_BLOCK_SIZE,GL_UNPACK_COMPRESSED_BLOCK_WIDTH,GL_UNPACK_COMPRESSED_BLOCK_HEIGHT,
            andGL_UNPACK_COMPRESSED_BLOCK_DEPTH, respectively.bsis the compressed block size in bytes;bw,bh,
            andbdare the compressed block width, height, and depth in pixels. By default the pixel storage modesGL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH,GL_UNPACK_SKIP_ROWS,GL_UNPACK_SKIP_PIXELS,GL_UNPACK_IMAGE_HEIGHTandGL_UNPACK_SKIP_IMAGESare ignored for compressed images. To enableGL_UNPACK_SKIP_PIXELSandGL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH,bsandbwmust both be non-zero.

            To also enableGL_UNPACK_SKIP_IMAGES,bdmust be non-zero. All parameters must be consistent with the compressed format to produce the desired results. When selecting a sub-rectangle from a compressed image: the value ofGL_UNPACK_SKIP_PIXELSmust be a multiple ofbw; the value ofGL_UNPACK_SKIP_ROWSmust be a multiple ofbw; the value ofGL_UNPACK_SKIP_IMAGESmust be a multiple ofbw. imageSizemust be equal to: bs×widthbw×heightbh×depthbd

/**
 * @brief set front and back stencil test actions
 *
 * Stenciling,
            like depth-buffering,
            enables and disables drawing on a per-pixel basis.
            You draw into the stencil planes using GL drawing primitives,
            then render geometry and images,
            using the stencil planes to mask out portions of the screen.
            Stenciling is typically used in multipass rendering algorithms
            to achieve special effects,
            such as decals,
            outlining,
            and constructive solid geometry rendering. The stencil test conditionally eliminates a pixel based on the outcome
            of a comparison between the value in the stencil buffer and a
            reference value. To enable and disable the test, callglEnableandglDisablewith argumentGL_STENCIL_TEST; to control it, callglStencilFuncorglStencilFuncSeparate. There can be two separate sets ofsfail,dpfail, anddppassparameters; one affects back-facing polygons, and the other
            affects front-facing polygons as well as other non-polygon primitives.glStencilOpsets both front
            and back stencil state to the same values. UseglStencilOpSeparateto set front and back stencil state to different values. glStencilOptakes three arguments that indicate what happens
            to the stored stencil value while stenciling is enabled.
            If the stencil test fails,
            no change is made to the pixel's color or depth buffers,
            andsfailspecifies what happens to the stencil buffer contents.
            The following eight actions are possible. Keeps the current value. Sets the stencil buffer value to 0. Sets the stencil buffer value toref,
                        as specified byglStencilFunc. Increments the current stencil buffer value.
                        Clamps to the maximum representable unsigned value. Increments the current stencil buffer value.
                        Wraps stencil buffer value to zero when incrementing the maximum
                        representable unsigned value. Decrements the current stencil buffer value.
                        Clamps to 0. Decrements the current stencil buffer value.
                        Wraps stencil buffer value to the maximum representable unsigned value when
                        decrementing a stencil buffer value of zero. Bitwise inverts the current stencil buffer value. Stencil buffer values are treated as unsigned integers.
            When incremented and decremented,
            values are clamped to 0 and2n-1,
            wherenis the value returned by queryingGL_STENCIL_BITS. The other two arguments toglStencilOpspecify stencil buffer actions
            that depend on whether subsequent depth buffer tests succeed (dppass)
            or fail (dpfail) (seeglDepthFunc).
            The actions are specified using the same eight symbolic constants assfail.
            Note thatdpfailis ignored when there is no depth buffer,
            or when the depth buffer is not enabled.
            In these cases,sfailanddppassspecify stencil action when the
            stencil test fails and passes,
            respectively.
 *
 * @param sfail Specifies the action to take when the stencil test fails.
                    Eight symbolic constants are accepted:GL_KEEP,GL_ZERO,GL_REPLACE,GL_INCR,GL_INCR_WRAP,GL_DECR,GL_DECR_WRAP, andGL_INVERT. The initial value isGL_KEEP.

            to the nearest integer.
            (If the rounding results in the value 0,
            it is as if the line width were 1.)

            that intersects the region lying within the rectangle having width
            equal to the current line width,
            length equal to the actual length of the line,

            The coverage value for each fragment is the window coordinate area
            of the intersection of the rectangular region with the corresponding
            pixel square.
            This value is saved and used in the final rasterization step. Not all widths can be supported when line antialiasing is enabled. If an
            unsupported width is requested, the nearest supported width is used.
            Only width 1 is guaranteed to be supported; others depend on the

    object specified byprogram. If any
    shader objects of typeGL_VERTEX_SHADERare
    attached toprogram, they will be used to
    create an executable that will run on the programmable vertex
    processor. If any shader objects of typeGL_GEOMETRY_SHADERare attached toprogram, they will be used to create
    an executable that will run on the programmable geometry processor.
    If any shader objects of typeGL_FRAGMENT_SHADERare attached toprogram, they will be used to create an
    executable that will run on the programmable fragment
    processor. The status of the link operation will be stored as part of
    the program object's state. This value will be set toGL_TRUEif the program object was linked
    without errors and is ready for use, andGL_FALSEotherwise. It can be queried by
    callingglGetProgramwith argumentsprogramandGL_LINK_STATUS. As a result of a successful link operation, all active
    user-defined uniform variables belonging toprogramwill be initialized to 0, and
    each of the program object's active uniform variables will be
    assigned a location that can be queried by callingglGetUniformLocation.
    Also, any active user-defined attribute variables that have not
    been bound to a generic vertex attribute index will be bound to
    one at this time. Linking of a program object can fail for a number of
    reasons as specified in theOpenGL Shading Language
    Specification. The following lists some of the
    conditions that will cause a link error. The number of active attribute variables supported
        by the implementation has been exceeded. The storage limit for uniform variables has been
        exceeded. The number of active uniform variables supported
        by the implementation has been exceeded. Themainfunction is missing
        for the vertex, geometry or fragment shader. A varying variable actually used in the fragment
        shader is not declared in the same way (or is not
        declared at all) in the vertex shader, or geometry shader shader if present. A reference to a function or variable name is
        unresolved. A shared global is declared with two different
        types or two different initial values. One or more of the attached shader objects has not
        been successfully compiled. Binding a generic attribute matrix caused some
        rows of the matrix to fall outside the allowed maximum
        ofGL_MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS. Not enough contiguous vertex attribute slots could
        be found to bind attribute matrices. The program object contains objects to form a fragment shader but
        does not contain objects to form a vertex shader. The program object contains objects to form a geometry shader
        but does not contain objects to form a vertex shader. The program object contains objects to form a geometry shader
        and the input primitive type, output primitive type, or maximum output
        vertex count is not specified in any compiled geometry shader
        object. The program object contains objects to form a geometry shader
        and the input primitive type, output primitive type, or maximum output
        vertex count is specified differently in multiple geometry shader
        objects. The number of active outputs in the fragment shader is greater
        than the value ofGL_MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS. The program has an active output assigned to a location greater
        than or equal to the value ofGL_MAX_DUAL_SOURCE_DRAW_BUFFERSand has an active output assigned an index greater than or equal to one. More than one varying out variable is bound to the same number and index. The explicit binding assigments do not leave enough space for the linker
        to automatically assign a location for a varying out array, which requires
        multiple contiguous locations. Thecountspecified byglTransformFeedbackVaryingsis non-zero, but the program object has no vertex or geometry shader. Any variable name specified toglTransformFeedbackVaryingsin thevaryingsarray is not declared as an output in the vertex shader (or the geometry shader, if active). Any two entries in thevaryingsarray givenglTransformFeedbackVaryingsspecify the same varying variable. The total number of components to capture in any transform feedback varying variable
        is  greater  than  the  constantGL_MAX_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_SEPARATE_COMPONENTSand the buffer mode isGL_SEPARATE_ATTRIBS. When a program object has been successfully linked, the
    program object can be made part of current state by callingglUseProgram.
    Whether or not the link operation was successful, the program
    object's information log will be overwritten. The information
    log can be retrieved by callingglGetProgramInfoLog. glLinkProgramwill also install the
    generated executables as part of the current rendering state if
    the link operation was successful and the specified program
    object is already currently in use as a result of a previous
    call toglUseProgram.
    If the program object currently in use is relinked
    unsuccessfully, its link status will be set toGL_FALSE, but the executables and
    associated state will remain part of the current state until a
    subsequent call toglUseProgramremoves it
    from use. After it is removed from use, it cannot be made part
    of current state until it has been successfully relinked. Ifprogramcontains shader objects
    of typeGL_VERTEX_SHADER, and optionally of typeGL_GEOMETRY_SHADER,
    but does not contain shader objects of typeGL_FRAGMENT_SHADER, the vertex shader executable will
    be installed on the programmable vertex processor, the geometry shader executable, if present,
    will be installed on the programmable geometry processor, but no executable will
    be installed on the fragment processor. The results of
    rasterizing primitives with such a program will be undefined. The program object's information log is updated and the
    program is generated at the time of the link operation. After
    the link operation, applications are free to modify attached
    shader objects, compile attached shader objects, detach shader
    objects, delete shader objects, and attach additional shader
    objects. None of these operations affects the information log or
    the program that is part of the program object.

/**
 * @brief specify a three-dimensional texture image
 *
 * Texturing maps a portion of a specified texture image
            onto each graphical primitive for which texturing is enabled.
            To enable and disable three-dimensional texturing, callglEnableandglDisablewith argumentGL_TEXTURE_3D. To define texture images, callglTexImage3D.
            The arguments describe the parameters of the texture image,
            such as height,
            width, depth,
            width of the border,
            level-of-detail number
            (seeglTexParameter),
            and number of color components provided.
            The last three arguments describe how the image is represented in memory. IftargetisGL_PROXY_TEXTURE_3D, no data is read fromdata, but
            all of the texture image state is recalculated, checked for
            consistency, and checked
            against the implementation's capabilities. If the implementation cannot
            handle a texture of the requested texture size, it sets
            all of the image state to 0,
            but does not generate an error (seeglGetError). To query for an
            entire mipmap array, use an image array level greater than or equal to
            1. IftargetisGL_TEXTURE_3D,
            data is read fromdataas a sequence of signed or unsigned bytes,
            shorts,
            or longs,
            or single-precision floating-point values,
            depending ontype.
            These values are grouped into sets of one,
            two,
            three,
            or four values,
            depending onformat,
            to form elements.
            Each data byte is treated as eight 1-bit elements,
            with bit ordering determined byGL_UNPACK_LSB_FIRST(seeglPixelStore). If a non-zero named buffer object is bound to theGL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFERtarget
            (seeglBindBuffer) while a texture image is
            specified,datais treated as a byte offset into the buffer object's data store. The first element corresponds to the lower left corner of the texture
            image.
            Subsequent elements progress left-to-right through the remaining texels
            in the lowest row of the texture image, and then in successively higher
            rows of the texture image.
            The final element corresponds to the upper right corner of the texture
            image. formatdetermines the composition of each element indata.
            It can assume one of these symbolic values: Each element is a single red component.
                        The GL converts it to floating point and assembles it into an RGBA element
                        by attaching 0 for green and blue, and 1 for alpha.
                        Each component is clamped to the range [0,1]. Each element is a red and green pair.
                        The GL converts each to floating point and assembles it into an RGBA element
                        by attaching 0 for blue, and 1 for alpha.
                        Each component is clamped to the range [0,1]. Each element is an RGB triple.
                        The GL converts it to floating point and assembles it into an RGBA element
                        by attaching 1 for alpha.
                        Each component is clamped to the range [0,1]. Each element contains all four components.
                        Each component is clamped to the range [0,1]. If an application wants to store the texture at a certain
            resolution or in a certain format, it can request the resolution
            and format withinternalFormat. The GL will choose an internal
            representation that closely approximates that requested byinternalFormat, but
            it may not match exactly.
            (The representations specified byGL_RED,GL_RG,GL_RGB,
            andGL_RGBAmust match exactly.) internalFormatmay be one of the base internal formats shown in
            Table 1, below internalFormatmay also be one of the sized internal formats
            shown in Table 2, below Finally,internalFormatmay also be one of the generic or compressed
            compressed texture formats shown in Table 3 below If theinternalFormatparameter is one of the generic compressed formats,GL_COMPRESSED_RED,GL_COMPRESSED_RG,GL_COMPRESSED_RGB, orGL_COMPRESSED_RGBA, the GL will replace the internal format with the symbolic constant for a specific internal format and compress the texture before storage.  If no corresponding internal format is available, or the GL can not compress that image for any reason, the internal format is instead replaced with a corresponding base internal format. If theinternalFormatparameter isGL_SRGB,GL_SRGB8,GL_SRGB_ALPHA, orGL_SRGB8_ALPHA8, the texture is treated as if the red, green, blue, or luminance components are encoded in the sRGB color space.    Any alpha component is left unchanged.  The conversion from the sRGB encoded componentcsto a linear componentclis: cl={cs12.92ifcs≤0.04045(cs+0.0551.055)2.4ifcs>0.04045 Assumecsis the sRGB component in the range [0,1]. Use theGL_PROXY_TEXTURE_3Dtarget to try out a resolution and
            format. The implementation will
            update and recompute its best match for the requested storage resolution
            and format. To then query this state, callglGetTexLevelParameter.
            If the texture cannot be accommodated, texture state is set to 0. A one-component texture image uses only the red component of the RGBA
            color extracted fromdata.
            A two-component image uses the R and A values.
            A three-component image uses the R, G, and B values.
            A four-component image uses all of the RGBA components.

/**
 * @brief set front and/or back stencil test actions
 *
 * Stenciling,
            like depth-buffering,
            enables and disables drawing on a per-pixel basis.
            You draw into the stencil planes using GL drawing primitives,
            then render geometry and images,
            using the stencil planes to mask out portions of the screen.
            Stenciling is typically used in multipass rendering algorithms
            to achieve special effects,
            such as decals,
            outlining,
            and constructive solid geometry rendering. The stencil test conditionally eliminates a pixel based on the outcome
            of a comparison between the value in the stencil buffer and a
            reference value. To enable and disable the test, callglEnableandglDisablewith argumentGL_STENCIL_TEST; to control it, callglStencilFuncorglStencilFuncSeparate. There can be two separate sets ofsfail,dpfail, anddppassparameters; one affects back-facing polygons, and the other
            affects front-facing polygons as well as other non-polygon primitives.glStencilOpsets both front
            and back stencil state to the same values, as ifglStencilOpSeparatewere called
            withfaceset toGL_FRONT_AND_BACK. glStencilOpSeparatetakes three arguments that indicate what happens
            to the stored stencil value while stenciling is enabled.
            If the stencil test fails,
            no change is made to the pixel's color or depth buffers,
            andsfailspecifies what happens to the stencil buffer contents.
            The following eight actions are possible. Keeps the current value. Sets the stencil buffer value to 0. Sets the stencil buffer value toref,
                        as specified byglStencilFunc. Increments the current stencil buffer value.
                        Clamps to the maximum representable unsigned value. Increments the current stencil buffer value.
                        Wraps stencil buffer value to zero when incrementing the maximum
                        representable unsigned value. Decrements the current stencil buffer value.
                        Clamps to 0. Decrements the current stencil buffer value.
                        Wraps stencil buffer value to the maximum representable unsigned value when
                        decrementing a stencil buffer value of zero. Bitwise inverts the current stencil buffer value. Stencil buffer values are treated as unsigned integers.
            When incremented and decremented,
            values are clamped to 0 and2n-1,
            wherenis the value returned by queryingGL_STENCIL_BITS. The other two arguments toglStencilOpSeparatespecify stencil buffer actions
            that depend on whether subsequent depth buffer tests succeed (dppass)
            or fail (dpfail) (seeglDepthFunc).
            The actions are specified using the same eight symbolic constants assfail.
            Note thatdpfailis ignored when there is no depth buffer,
            or when the depth buffer is not enabled.
            In these cases,sfailanddppassspecify stencil action when the
            stencil test fails and passes,
            respectively.
 *
 * @param face Specifies whether front and/or back stencil state is updated.
                    Three symbolic constants are valid:GL_FRONT,GL_BACK, andGL_FRONT_AND_BACK.

                    Eight symbolic constants are accepted:GL_KEEP,GL_ZERO,GL_REPLACE,GL_INCR,GL_INCR_WRAP,GL_DECR,GL_DECR_WRAP, andGL_INVERT. The initial value isGL_KEEP.

/**
 * @brief define front- and back-facing polygons
 *
 * In a scene composed entirely of opaque closed surfaces,
            back-facing polygons are never visible.
            Eliminating these invisible polygons has the obvious benefit
            of speeding up the rendering of the image.
            To enable and disable elimination of back-facing polygons, callglEnableandglDisablewith argumentGL_CULL_FACE. The projection of a polygon to window coordinates is said to have
            clockwise winding if an imaginary object following the path
            from its first vertex,
            its second vertex,
            and so on,
            to its last vertex,
            and finally back to its first vertex,
            moves in a clockwise direction about the interior of the polygon.
            The polygon's winding is said to be counterclockwise if the imaginary
            object following the same path moves in a counterclockwise direction
            about the interior of the polygon.glFrontFacespecifies whether polygons with clockwise winding in window coordinates,

            By default, counterclockwise polygons are taken to be front-facing.

/**
 * @brief check if the rendering context has not been lost due to software or hardware issues
 *
 * Certain events can result in a reset of the GL context. Such a reset causes
            all context state to be lost and requires the application to recreate all
            objects in the affected context. glGetGraphicsResetStatuscan return one of the following
            constants: Indicates that the GL context has not been in a reset state since
                        the last call. Indicates that a reset has been detected that is attributable to
                        the current GL context. Indicates a reset has been detected that is not attributable to
                        the current GL context. Indicates a detected graphics reset whose cause is unknown. If a reset status other thanGL_NO_ERRORis returned
            and subsequent calls returnGL_NO_ERROR, the context
            reset was encountered and completed. If a reset status is repeatedly
            returned, the context may be in the process of resetting. Reset notification behavior is determined at context creation time, and
            may be queried by callingGetIntegervwith the
            symbolic constantGL_RESET_NOTIFICATION_STRATEGY. If the reset notification behavior isGL_NO_RESET_NOTIFICATION, then the
            implementation will never deliver notification of reset events,
            andglGetGraphicsResetStatuswill always
            returnGL_NO_ERROR. If the behavior isGL_LOSE_CONTEXT_ON_RESET, a graphics reset
            will result in the loss of all context state, requiring the recreation of all
            associated objects. In this caseglGetGraphicsResetStatusmay return any of the values described above. If a graphics reset notification occurs in a context, a notification must also occur
            in all other contexts which share objects with that context. After a graphics reset has occurred on a context, subsequent GL commands on that
            context (or any context which shares with that context) will generate aGL_CONTEXT_LOSTerror. Such commands will not have
            side effects (in particular, they will not modify memory passed by pointer
            for query results), and will not block indefinitely or cause termination
            of the application. There are two important exceptions to this behavior: glGetErrorandglGetGraphicsResetStatusbehave normally following a graphics reset, so that the application can
                        determine a reset has occurred, and when it is safe to destroy and re-create
                        the context. Any commands which might cause a polling application to block indefinitely
                        will generate aGL_CONTEXT_LOSTerror, but will also return
                        a value indicating completion to the application. Such commands include: glGetSyncivwith pnameGL_SYNC_STATUSignores the other parameters and returnsGL_SIGNALEDinvalues. glGetQueryObjectuivwith pnameGL_QUERY_RESULT_AVAILABLEignores the other parameters and returnsTRUEinparams.

 * In order to use the Transform Feedback functionality, you need to

    achieved by either usingglBindBufferBaseorglBindBuffersBaseto associate whole buffer object
    storage to one of the Transform Feedback Binding Points, or by callingglBindBufferRangeorglBindBuffersRangeto use a region of a buffer object
    storage for the binding. You may want to (but are not required to) bind a
    Transform Feedback Object first, in order to cache the binding
    configuration. This usually allows you to restore the Transform Feedback
    configuration faster, than if you were to execute a list of API calls
    necessary to set up the Transform Feedback state of your liking. This reference page discusses two types of getters that operate on
    Transform Feedback Objects and their bindings. The first class operates on general Transform Feedback binding point
    and includesglGetTransformFeedbackivfunction.glGetTransformFeedbackivcan be used to retrieve
    information about Transform Feedback object bound to the general Transform
    Feedback binding point, as configured with aglBindTransformFeedbackcall. In this case, you can

 *
 * Stenciling,
            like depth-buffering,
            enables and disables drawing on a per-pixel basis.
            You draw into the stencil planes using GL drawing primitives,
            then render geometry and images,
            using the stencil planes to mask out portions of the screen.
            Stenciling is typically used in multipass rendering algorithms
            to achieve special effects,
            such as decals,
            outlining,
            and constructive solid geometry rendering. The stencil test conditionally eliminates a pixel based on the outcome
            of a comparison between the reference value
            and the value in the stencil buffer.
            To enable and disable the test, callglEnableandglDisablewith argumentGL_STENCIL_TEST.
            To specify actions based on the outcome of the stencil test, callglStencilOporglStencilOpSeparate. There can be two separate sets offunc,ref, andmaskparameters; one affects back-facing polygons, and the other
            affects front-facing polygons as well as other non-polygon primitives.glStencilFuncsets both front
            and back stencil state to the same values, as ifglStencilFuncSeparatewere called

            It accepts one of eight values,

            It is clamped to the range02n-1,
            wherenis the number of bitplanes in the stencil buffer.maskis bitwise ANDed with both the reference value
            and the stored stencil value,
            with the ANDed values participating in the comparison. Ifstencilrepresents the value stored in the corresponding
            stencil buffer location,
            the following list shows the effect of each comparison function
            that can be specified byfunc.
            Only if the comparison succeeds is the pixel passed through
            to the next stage in the rasterization process
            (seeglStencilOp).
            All tests treatstencilvalues as unsigned integers in the range02n-1,

 * glMemoryBarrierdefines a barrier ordering
            the memory transactions issued prior to the command relative to
            those issued after the barrier. For the purposes of this
            ordering, memory transactions performed by shaders are
            considered to be issued by the rendering command that triggered
            the execution of the shader.barriersis
            a bitfield indicating the set of operations that are
            synchronized with shader stores; the bits used inbarriersare as follows: If set, vertex data sourced from
                        buffer objects after the barrier will reflect data written by shaders
                        prior to the barrier.  The set of buffer objects affected by this bit
                        is derived from the buffer object bindings used for
                        generic vertex attributes derived from theGL_VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_BUFFERbindings. If set, vertex array indices sourced from
                        buffer objects after the barrier will reflect data written by shaders
                        prior to the barrier.  The buffer objects affected by this bit are
                        derived from theGL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFERbinding. Shader uniforms sourced from buffer objects after the barrier will reflect data
                        written by shaders prior to the barrier. Texture fetches from shaders, including
                        fetches from buffer object memory via buffer textures, after the
                        barrier will reflect data written by shaders prior to the barrier. Memory accesses using shader image
                        load, store, and atomic built-in functions issued after the barrier
                        will reflect data written by shaders prior to the barrier.
                        Additionally, image stores and atomics issued after the barrier will
                        not execute until all memory accesses (e.g., loads, stores, texture
                        fetches, vertex fetches) initiated prior to the barrier complete. Command data sourced from buffer objects by
                        Draw*Indirect commands after the barrier will reflect data written by
                        shaders prior to the barrier.  The buffer objects affected by this bit
                        are derived from theGL_DRAW_INDIRECT_BUFFERbinding. Reads and writes of buffer objects via theGL_PIXEL_PACK_BUFFERandGL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFERbindings (viaglReadPixels,glTexSubImage, etc.) after the
                        barrier will reflect data written by shaders prior to the barrier.
                        Additionally, buffer object writes issued after the barrier will wait
                        on the completion of all shader writes initiated prior to the barrier. Writes to a texture viaglTex(Sub)Image*,glCopyTex(Sub)Image*,glCompressedTex(Sub)Image*, and reads viaglGetTexImageafter the barrier will reflect data written by shaders
                        prior to the barrier.  Additionally, texture writes from these
                        commands issued after the barrier will not execute until all shader
                        writes initiated prior to the barrier complete. Reads or writes viaglBufferSubData,glCopyBufferSubData,
                        orglGetBufferSubData, or

                        will reflect data written by shaders prior to the barrier.
                        Additionally, writes via these commands issued after the barrier will
                        wait on the completion of any shader writes to the same memory
                        initiated prior to the barrier. Reads and writes via framebuffer object
                        attachments after the barrier will reflect data written by shaders
                        prior to the barrier.  Additionally, framebuffer writes issued after
                        the barrier will wait on the completion of all shader writes issued
                        prior to the barrier. Writes via transform feedback
                        bindings after the barrier will reflect data written by shaders prior
                        to the barrier.  Additionally, transform feedback writes issued after
                        the barrier will wait on the completion of all shader writes issued
                        prior to the barrier. Accesses to atomic counters after the
                        barrier will reflect writes prior to the barrier. Accesses to shader storage blocks after the
                        barrier will reflect writes prior to the barrier. Writes of buffer objects via theGL_QUERY_BUFFERbinding after the barrier will reflect data written
                        by shaders prior to the barrier. Additionally, buffer object writes
                        issued after the barrier will wait on the completion of all shader
                        writes initiated prior to the barrier. IfbarriersisGL_ALL_BARRIER_BITS, shader memory accesses
            will be synchronized relative to all the operations described
            above. Implementations may cache buffer object and texture image memory that
            could be written by shaders in multiple caches; for example, there may be
            separate caches for texture, vertex fetching, and one or more caches for
            shader memory accesses.  Implementations are not required to keep these
            caches coherent with shader memory writes.  Stores issued by one
            invocation may not be immediately observable by other pipeline stages or
            other shader invocations because the value stored may remain in a cache
            local to the processor executing the store, or because data overwritten by
            the store is still in a cache elsewhere in the system. WhenglMemoryBarrieris called, the GL flushes
            and/or invalidates any caches relevant to the operations
            specified by thebarriersparameter to
            ensure consistent ordering of operations across the barrier. To allow for independent shader invocations to communicate by reads and
            writes to a common memory address, image variables in the OpenGL Shading
            Language may be declared as "coherent".  Buffer object or texture image
            memory accessed through such variables may be cached only if caches are
            automatically updated due to stores issued by any other shader invocation.
            If the same address is accessed using both coherent and non-coherent
            variables, the accesses using variables declared as coherent will observe
            the results stored using coherent variables in other invocations.  Using
            variables declared as "coherent" guarantees only that the results of
            stores will be immediately visible to shader invocations using
            similarly-declared variables; callingglMemoryBarrieris required to ensure that
            the stores are visible to other operations. The following guidelines may be helpful in choosing when to use coherent
            memory accesses and when to use barriers. Data that are read-only or constant may be accessed
                        without using coherent variables or callingMemoryBarrier(). Updates to the
                        read-only data via API calls such asglBufferSubDatawill invalidate
                        shader caches implicitly as required. Data that are shared between shader invocations at a
                        fine granularity (e.g., written by one invocation,
                        consumed by another invocation) should use coherent
                        variables to read and write the shared data. Data written by one shader invocation and consumed
                        by other shader invocations launched as a result of
                        its execution ("dependent invocations")
                        should use coherent variables in the producing
                        shader invocation and callmemoryBarrier() after the last
                        write. The consuming shader invocation should also
                        use coherent variables. Data written to image variables in one rendering
                        pass and read by the shader in a later pass need not
                        use coherent variables or memoryBarrier(). CallingglMemoryBarrierwith the
                        SHADER_IMAGE_ACCESS_BARRIER_BIT set inbarriersbetween passes is
                        necessary. Data written by the shader in one rendering pass and
                        read by another mechanism (e.g., vertex or index
                        buffer pulling) in a later pass need not use
                        coherent variables ormemoryBarrier(). CallingglMemoryBarrierwith the
                        appropriate bits set inbarriersbetween passes is
                        necessary.

 *
 * glMapBufferRangeandglMapNamedBufferRangemap all or part of
            the data store of a specified buffer object into the client's
            address space.offsetandlengthindicate the range of data in the
            buffer object that is to be mapped, in terms of basic machine
            units.accessis a bitfield containing
            flags which describe the requested mapping. These flags are
            described below. A pointer to the beginning of the mapped range is returned once
            all pending operations on the buffer object have completed, and
            may be used to modify and/or query the corresponding range of
            the data store according to the following flag bits set inaccess: GL_MAP_READ_BITindicates that
                        the returned pointer may be used to read buffer
                        object data. No GL error is generated if the pointer
                        is used to query a mapping which excludes this flag,
                        but the result is undefined and system errors
                        (possibly including program termination) may occur. GL_MAP_WRITE_BITindicates that
                        the returned pointer may be used to modify buffer
                        object data. No GL error is generated if the pointer
                        is used to modify a mapping which excludes this
                        flag, but the result is undefined and system errors
                        (possibly including program termination) may occur. GL_MAP_PERSISTENT_BITindicates
                        that the mapping is to be made in a persistent
                        fassion and that the client intends to hold and use
                        the returned pointer during subsequent GL operation.
                        It is not an error to call drawing commands (render)
                        while buffers are mapped using this flag. It is an
                        error to specify this flag if the buffer's data
                        store was not allocated through a call to theglBufferStoragecommand in which theGL_MAP_PERSISTENT_BITwas also
                        set. GL_MAP_COHERENT_BITindicates
                        that a persistent mapping is also to be coherent.
                        Coherent maps guarantee that the effect of writes to
                        a buffer's data store by either the client or server
                        will eventually become visible to the other without
                        further intervention from the application. In the
                        absence of this bit, persistent mappings are not
                        coherent and modified ranges of the buffer store
                        must be explicitly communicated to the GL, either by
                        unmapping the buffer, or through a call toglFlushMappedBufferRangeorglMemoryBarrier. The followingoptionalflag bits inaccessmay be used to modify the mapping: GL_MAP_INVALIDATE_RANGE_BITindicates that the previous contents of the
                        specified range may be discarded. Data within this
                        range are undefined with the exception of
                        subsequently written data. No GL error is generated
                        if subsequent GL operations access unwritten data,
                        but the result is undefined and system errors
                        (possibly including program termination) may occur.
                        This flag may not be used in combination withGL_MAP_READ_BIT. GL_MAP_INVALIDATE_BUFFER_BITindicates that the previous contents of the entire
                        buffer may be discarded. Data within the entire
                        buffer are undefined with the exception of
                        subsequently written data. No GL error is generated
                        if subsequent GL operations access unwritten data,
                        but the result is undefined and system errors
                        (possibly including program termination) may occur.
                        This flag may not be used in combination withGL_MAP_READ_BIT. GL_MAP_FLUSH_EXPLICIT_BITindicates that one or more discrete subranges of the
                        mapping may be modified. When this flag is set,
                        modifications to each subrange must be explicitly
                        flushed by callingglFlushMappedBufferRange.
                        No GL error is set if a subrange of the mapping is
                        modified and not flushed, but data within the
                        corresponding subrange of the buffer are undefined.
                        This flag may only be used in conjunction withGL_MAP_WRITE_BIT. When this
                        option is selected, flushing is strictly limited to
                        regions that are explicitly indicated with calls toglFlushMappedBufferRangeprior to unmap; if this option is not selectedglUnmapBufferwill automatically flush the entire mapped range
                        when called. GL_MAP_UNSYNCHRONIZED_BITindicates that the GL should not attempt to
                        synchronize pending operations on the buffer prior
                        to returning fromglMapBufferRangeorglMapNamedBufferRange. No GL
                        error is generated if pending operations which
                        source or modify the buffer overlap the mapped
                        region, but the result of such previous and any
                        subsequent operations is undefined. If an error occurs, aNULLpointer is returned. If no error occurs, the returned pointer will reflect an
            allocation aligned to the value ofGL_MIN_MAP_BUFFER_ALIGNMENTbasic machine
            units. Subtractingoffsetfrom this
            returned pointer will always produce a multiple of the value ofGL_MIN_MAP_BUFFER_ALIGNMENT. The returned pointer values may not be passed as parameter
            values to GL commands. For example, they may not be used to
            specify array pointers, or to specify or query pixel or texture
            image data; such actions produce undefined results, although
            implementations may not check for such behavior for performance
            reasons. Mappings to the data stores of buffer objects may have
            nonstandard performance characteristics. For example, such
            mappings may be marked as uncacheable regions of memory, and in
            such cases reading from them may be very slow. To ensure optimal
            performance, the client should use the mapping in a fashion
            consistent with the values ofGL_BUFFER_USAGE(seeglGet*BufferParameterandusageofglBufferData) for the buffer object and
            ofaccess. Using a mapping in a fashion
            inconsistent with these values is liable to be multiple orders
            of magnitude slower than using normal memory.

            success, the value of the parameter for each uniform is written
            into the corresponding entry in the array whose address is given
            inparams. If an error is generated,
            nothing is written intoparams. IfpnameisGL_UNIFORM_TYPE, then an array identifying
            the types of uniforms specified by the corresponding array ofuniformIndicesis returned. The returned
            types can be any of the values from the following table: IfpnameisGL_UNIFORM_SIZE, then an array identifying the
            size of the uniforms specified by the corresponding array ofuniformIndicesis
            returned. The sizes returned are in units of the type returned by a query ofGL_UNIFORM_TYPE.
            For active uniforms that are arrays, the size is the number of active elements in the array;
            for all other uniforms, the size is one. IfpnameisGL_UNIFORM_NAME_LENGTH, then an array identifying the
            length, including the terminating null character, of the uniform name strings specified by the corresponding
            array ofuniformIndicesis returned. IfpnameisGL_UNIFORM_BLOCK_INDEX, then an array identifying the
            the uniform block index of each of the uniforms specified by the corresponding array ofuniformIndicesis returned. The uniform block index of a uniform associated with the default uniform block is -1. IfpnameisGL_UNIFORM_OFFSET, then an array of uniform buffer
            offsets is returned. For uniforms in a named uniform block, the returned value will be its offset, in basic
            machine units, relative to the beginning of the uniform block in the buffer object data store.
            For atomic counter uniforms, the returned value will be its offset relative to the beginning of its active
            atomic counter buffer.
            For all other uniforms, -1 will be returned. IfpnameisGL_UNIFORM_ARRAY_STRIDE, then an array identifying the
            stride between elements of each of the uniforms specified by the corresponding array ofuniformIndicesis returned.
            For uniforms in named uniform blocks and for uniforms declared as atomic counters, the stride is the difference,
            in basic machine units, of consecutive elements in an array, or zero for uniforms not declared as an array.
            For all other uniforms, a stride of -1 will be returned. IfpnameisGL_UNIFORM_MATRIX_STRIDE, then an array identifying the stride
            between columns of a column-major matrix or rows of a row-major matrix, in basic machine units, of each of the uniforms
            specified by the corresponding array ofuniformIndicesis returned. The matrix stride of a
            uniform associated with the default uniform block is -1. Note that this information only makes sense for uniforms
            that are matrices. For uniforms that are not matrices, but are declared in a named uniform block, a matrix stride of
            zero is returned. IfpnameisGL_UNIFORM_IS_ROW_MAJOR, then an array identifying whether each
            of the uniforms specified by the corresponding array ofuniformIndicesis a row-major matrix or not is returned. A
            value of one indicates a row-major matrix, and a value of zero indicates a column-major matrix, a matrix in the default
            uniform block, or a non-matrix. IfpnameisGL_UNIFORM_ATOMIC_COUNTER_BUFFER_INDEX, then an array
            identifying the active atomic counter buffer index of each of the uniforms specified by the corresponding array
            ofuniformIndicesis returned. For uniforms other than atomic counters, the returned buffer
            index is -1. The returned indices may be passed toglGetActiveAtomicCounterBufferivto query the properties of the associated buffer, and not necessarily the binding point specified in the uniform declaration.

Six of the twelve storage parameters affect
            how pixel data is returned to client memory.
            They are as follows: If true,

                        For example,
                        the three components of aGL_RGBformat pixel are always stored with

                        the first bit in each byte is the most significant one. If greater than 0,GL_PACK_ROW_LENGTHdefines the number of pixels in a row.

                        In the case of 1-bit values,

/**
 * @brief Returns information about an active uniform variable for the specified program object
 *
 * glGetActiveUniformreturns
    information about an active uniform variable in the program
    object specified byprogram. The number
    of active uniform variables can be obtained by callingglGetProgramwith the valueGL_ACTIVE_UNIFORMS. A value
    of 0 forindexselects the first active
    uniform variable. Permissible values forindexrange from zero to the number of
    active uniform variables minus one. Shaders may use either built-in uniform variables,
    user-defined uniform variables, or both. Built-in uniform
    variables have a prefix of "gl_" and reference
    existing OpenGL state or values derived from such state (e.g.,gl_DepthRangeParameters, see the OpenGL
    Shading Language specification for a complete list.)
    User-defined uniform variables have arbitrary names and obtain
    their values from the application through calls toglUniform.
    A uniform variable (either built-in or user-defined) is
    considered active if it is determined during the link operation
    that it may be accessed during program execution. Therefore,programshould have previously been the
    target of a call toglLinkProgram,
    but it is not necessary for it to have been linked
    successfully. The size of the character buffer required to store the
    longest uniform variable name inprogramcan be obtained by callingglGetProgramwith the valueGL_ACTIVE_UNIFORM_MAX_LENGTH. This value
    should be used to allocate a buffer of sufficient size to store
    the returned uniform variable name. The size of this character
    buffer is passed inbufSize, and a
    pointer to this character buffer is passed inname. glGetActiveUniformreturns the name
    of the uniform variable indicated byindex, storing it in the character buffer
    specified byname. The string returned
    will be null terminated. The actual number of characters written
    into this buffer is returned inlength,
    and this count does not include the null termination character.
    If the length of the returned string is not required, a value ofNULLcan be passed in thelengthargument. Thetypeargument will return a pointer to the uniform variable's data
    type. The symbolic constants returned for uniform types are shown in the
    table below. If one or more elements of an array are active, the name
    of the array is returned inname, the
    type is returned intype, and thesizeparameter returns the highest array
    element index used, plus one, as determined by the compiler
    and/or linker. Only one active uniform variable will be reported
    for a uniform array. Uniform variables that are declared as structures or
    arrays of structures will not be returned directly by this
    function. Instead, each of these uniform variables will be
    reduced to its fundamental components containing the
    "." and "[]" operators such that each of the
    names is valid as an argument toglGetUniformLocation.
    Each of these reduced uniform variables is counted as one active
    uniform variable and is assigned an index. A valid name cannot
    be a structure, an array of structures, or a subcomponent of a
    vector or matrix. The size of the uniform variable will be returned insize. Uniform variables other than arrays
    will have a size of 1. Structures and arrays of structures will
    be reduced as described earlier, such that each of the names
    returned will be a data type in the earlier list. If this
    reduction results in an array, the size returned will be as
    described for uniform arrays; otherwise, the size returned will
    be 1. The list of active uniform variables may include both
    built-in uniform variables (which begin with the prefix
    "gl_") as well as user-defined uniform variable
    names. This function will return as much information as it can
    about the specified active uniform variable. If no information
    is available,lengthwill be 0, andnamewill be an empty string. This
    situation could occur if this function is called after a link
    operation that failed. If an error occurs, the return valueslength,size,type, andnamewill be unmodified.

/**
 * @brief Specifies the value of a generic vertex attribute
 *
 * TheglVertexAttribfamily of entry points
    allows an application to pass generic vertex attributes in
    numbered locations. Generic attributes are defined as four-component values
    that are organized into an array. The first entry of this array
    is numbered 0, and the size of the array is specified by the
    implementation-dependent constantGL_MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS. Individual elements
    of this array can be modified with aglVertexAttribcall that specifies the
    index of the element to be modified and a value for that
    element. These commands can be used to specify one, two, three, or
    all four components of the generic vertex attribute specified byindex. A1in the
    name of the command indicates that only one value is passed, and
    it will be used to modify the first component of the generic
    vertex attribute. The second and third components will be set to
    0, and the fourth component will be set to 1. Similarly, a2in the name of the command indicates that
    values are provided for the first two components, the third
    component will be set to 0, and the fourth component will be set
    to 1. A3in the name of the command
    indicates that values are provided for the first three
    components and the fourth component will be set to 1, whereas a4in the name indicates that values are
    provided for all four components. The letterss,f,i,d,ub,us, anduiindicate
    whether the arguments are of type short, float, int, double,
    unsigned byte, unsigned short, or unsigned int. Whenvis appended to the name, the commands can
    take a pointer to an array of such values. Additional capitalized letters can indicate further alterations
        to the default behavior of the glVertexAttrib function: The commands containingNindicate that
            the arguments will be passed as fixed-point values that are
            scaled to a normalized range according to the component
            conversion rules defined by the OpenGL specification. Signed
            values are understood to represent fixed-point values in the
            range [-1,1], and unsigned values are understood to represent
            fixed-point values in the range [0,1]. The commands containingIindicate that
            the arguments are extended to full signed or unsigned integers. The commands containingPindicate that
            the arguments are stored as packed components within a larger
            natural type. The commands containingLindicate that
            the arguments are full 64-bit quantities and should be passed directly
            to shader inputs declared as 64-bit double precision types. OpenGL Shading Language attribute variables are allowed to
    be of type mat2, mat3, or mat4. Attributes of these types may be
    loaded using theglVertexAttribentry
    points. Matrices must be loaded into successive generic
    attribute slots in column major order, with one column of the
    matrix in each generic attribute slot. A user-defined attribute variable declared in a vertex
    shader can be bound to a generic attribute index by callingglBindAttribLocation.
    This allows an application to use more descriptive variable
    names in a vertex shader. A subsequent change to the specified
    generic vertex attribute will be immediately reflected as a
    change to the corresponding attribute variable in the vertex
    shader. The binding between a generic vertex attribute index and a
    user-defined attribute variable in a vertex shader is part of
    the state of a program object, but the current value of the
    generic vertex attribute is not. The value of each generic
    vertex attribute is part of current state, just like standard
    vertex attributes, and it is maintained even if a different
    program object is used. An application may freely modify generic vertex attributes
    that are not bound to a named vertex shader attribute variable.
    These values are simply maintained as part of current state and
    will not be accessed by the vertex shader. If a generic vertex
    attribute bound to an attribute variable in a vertex shader is
    not updated while the vertex shader is executing, the vertex
    shader will repeatedly use the current value for the generic
    vertex attribute.

                        Each component is clamped to the range [0,1]. Each element is an RGB triple.
                        The GL converts it to floating point and assembles it into an RGBA element

                        Each component is clamped to the range [0,1]. Each element contains all four components.
                        Each component is clamped to the range [0,1]. Each element is a single depth value.
                        The GL converts it to floating point and clamps to the range [0,1]. Each element is a pair of depth and stencil values. The depth component of
                        the pair is interpreted as inGL_DEPTH_COMPONENT. The stencil
                        component is interpreted based on specified the depth + stencil internal format. If an application wants to store the texture at a certain
            resolution or in a certain format, it can request the resolution
            and format withinternalFormat. The GL will choose an internal
            representation that closely approximates that requested byinternalFormat, but
            it may not match exactly.
            (The representations specified byGL_RED,GL_RG,GL_RGB,
            andGL_RGBAmust match exactly.) internalFormatmay be one of the base internal formats shown in
            Table 1, below internalFormatmay also be one of the sized internal formats
            shown in Table 2, below Finally,internalFormatmay also be one of the generic or compressed
            compressed texture formats shown in Table 3 below If theinternalFormatparameter is one of the generic compressed formats,GL_COMPRESSED_RED,GL_COMPRESSED_RG,GL_COMPRESSED_RGB, orGL_COMPRESSED_RGBA, the GL will replace the internal format with the symbolic constant for a specific internal format and compress the texture before storage.  If no corresponding internal format is available, or the GL can not compress that image for any reason, the internal format is instead replaced with a corresponding base internal format. If theinternalFormatparameter isGL_SRGB,GL_SRGB8,GL_SRGB_ALPHA, orGL_SRGB8_ALPHA8, the texture is treated as if the red, green, or blue components are encoded in the sRGB color space.    Any alpha component is left unchanged.  The conversion from the sRGB encoded componentcsto a linear componentclis: cl={cs12.92ifcs≤0.04045(cs+0.0551.055)2.4ifcs>0.04045 Assumecsis the sRGB component in the range [0,1]. Use theGL_PROXY_TEXTURE_2D,GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY,GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE, orGL_PROXY_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAPtarget to try out a resolution and
            format. The implementation will
            update and recompute its best match for the requested storage resolution
            and format. To then query this state, callglGetTexLevelParameter.
            If the texture cannot be accommodated, texture state is set to 0. A one-component texture image uses only the red component of the RGBA
            color extracted fromdata.
            A two-component image uses the R and G values.
            A three-component image uses the R, G, and B values.
            A four-component image uses all of the RGBA components. Image-based shadowing can be enabled by comparing texture r coordinates to
                  depth texture values to generate a boolean result.
                  SeeglTexParameterfor details on texture comparison.

    reference conventional OpenGL vertex attribtes (e.g.,gl_Vertex,gl_Normal, etc., see the OpenGL Shading
    Language specification for a complete list.) User-defined
    attribute variables have arbitrary names and obtain their values
    through numbered generic vertex attributes. An attribute
    variable (either built-in or user-defined) is considered active

    the returned attribute name. The size of this character buffer
    is passed inbufSize, and a pointer to

    specified byname. The string returned
    will be null terminated. The actual number of characters written
    into this buffer is returned inlength,
    and this count does not include the null termination character.
    If the length of the returned string is not required, a value ofNULLcan be passed in thelengthargument. Thetypeargument specifies a
